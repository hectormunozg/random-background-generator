# jQuery Background Generator (check [demo](http://hectormunozg.github.io/random-background-generator/))

This little challenge was to create a button that automatically generates a new background color for the page, giving you the hex code to copy it.
Additionally, the colors are stored in an array in order to not repeat never a color.
